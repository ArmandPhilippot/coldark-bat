# Coldark - Bat

![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/ArmandPhilippot/coldark-bat?colorA=111b27&color=d0dae7&logo=Github&logoColor=e3eaf2&style=for-the-badge) ![GitHub package.json version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/ArmandPhilippot/coldark-bat?colorA=111b27&color=d0dae7&logo=Github&logoColor=e3eaf2&style=for-the-badge)

An optimized theme for web development that comes with two versions: light & dark.

## Presentation

[Coldark](https://github.com/ArmandPhilippot/coldark) is a gray-blue theme. The colors used respect the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) in order to provide sufficient reading comfort. However, with opacity, it is possible that some contrasts are diminished and that they are above level AA.

This Coldark version is designed for [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) command.

## Color pallets

Coldark consists of three color pallets. The first is common to both versions. The other two each apply to a version.

The `bat` version uses almost the same colors as [VS code version](https://github.com/ArmandPhilippot/coldark-vscode). The scopes seems a little different and a little less complete, hence the difference.

## Install

1. Install `bat` (on Manjaro: `pacman -S bat`)
2. Create themes folder: `mkdir -p "$(bat --config-dir)/themes"`
3. Go inside this new folder: `cd "$(bat --config-dir)/themes"`
4. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/ArmandPhilippot/coldark-bat`
5. Update the binary cache: `bat cache --build`

Then, if you use `bat --list-themes`, you should see the themes.

Coldark Bat is now present in [bat repo](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat). It may be present in the list of themes in a future version without having to install it manually.

## Activation

To select one of the Coldark themes, call `bat` with the `--theme=Coldark-Cold` (or `--theme=Coldark-Dark`) option or set the `BAT_THEME` environment variable to `Coldark-Cold` (or `Coldark-Dark`). Use `export BAT_THEME="Coldark-Cold"` (or `export BAT_THEME="Coldark-Dark"`) in your shell's startup file to make the change permanent.
